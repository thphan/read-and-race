        <p>I hope you and your toddler have a great time playing this game. I would love to share with you how the game "Read and Race" was born. </p>
        <img class="racing-game" src="images/game.jpg" alt="car-racing-game-img">
        <p>In 2020, COVID-19 pandemic caused a long "Stay-At-Home" period in the US. As a result, kids and their parents were stuck at home together. </p>
        <p>It was not easy to entertain a 2.5 year old toddler who was active all the time. I spent a sufficient amount of time searching on the Internet about early childhood education. And the result was... "the best way to learn is to <strong><em>play</em></strong>" (Hooray!).  So I should teach my toddler through fun and educational games. The idea of this game was inspired from the search.<br />
        The game was first implemented by drawing the road on paper. Together with a toy car and a box of wooden letters, we played the game by picking a random letter from the box and name it. If you got its name correctly, your car could proceed.
        My son loved cars so much and the game immediately caught his attention. We raced car and learnt letters at the same time (Yeah, it was great!) </p>
        <p>Coincidentally, I was taking an online Web Development course at that time. And I thought the game would be perfect practice for my study. That was the reason its web version came to life. <br />
        This is also my very first website and I am quite sure there are many rooms for improvements. I would welcome your suggestions to make it better.</p>
